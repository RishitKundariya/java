<h1> Questions are below. </h1>
<ul>
	<li>1. Write a program to create a circle class with an area function to find
the area of the circle. </li>
	<li>2. Define time class with hour and minute. Also define an addition
method to add two-time objects. </li>
	<li>3. Create a class which asks the user to enter a sentence, and it should
display the count of each vowel type in the sentence. The program
should continue till the user enters the word “quit”. Display the total
count of each vowel for all sentences. </li>
	<li>4. The Transport interface declares a deliver () method. The abstract
class Animal is the super class of the Tiger, Camel, Deer and Donkey
classes. The Transport interface is implemented by the Camel and
Donkey classes. Write a test program that initializes an array of four
Animal objects. If the object implements the Transport interface, the
deliver () method is invoked. </li>
	<li>5. The abstract vegetable class has three subclasses named Potato,
Brinjal and Tomato. Write a java prog. That demonstrates how to
establish this class hierarchy. Declare one instance variable of type
String that indicates the color of a vegetable. Crete and display
instances of these objects. Override the toString() method of the
object to return a string with the name of the vegetable and its color. </li>
	<li>6. Write a program that illustrates interface inheritance. Interface P is
extended by P1 and P2. Interface P12 inherits from both P1 and
P2.Each interface declares one constant and one method. Class B
implements P12. Instantiate B and invoke each of its methods. Each
method displays one of the constants. </li>
